**Official Distribution Model (Plugins)**

Hooks are now distributed as part of **plugins** via the `/plugin` command:
```bash
# Add a marketplace (GitHub repo)
/plugin marketplace add user-or-org/repo-name

# Browse and install
/plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

**Notable Community Marketplaces**
- Dan Ávila's marketplace offers plugins for DevOps automation, documentation generation, project management, and testing suites
- Seth Hobson has curated over 80 specialized sub-agents
- `ccplugins/marketplace` — curated collection
- `zpaper-com/ClaudeKit` — agents, commands, and hooks bundle

**Team Distribution**

Add `.claude/settings.json` to your repository with marketplace and plugin configurations. When team members trust the repository folder, Claude Code automatically installs specified plugins.

**For Discoverability Concerns**

There are third-party aggregators like `claudecodemarketplace.com` and `claudecodeplugin.com` that scrape GitHub for marketplaces — claudemarketplaces.com automatically scrapes GitHub to find new ones every hour. However, be aware these are **unverified** and have security implications (the PromptArmor article highlights real risks with malicious plugins bypassing permission guardrails).
